Project: Unity Game(2.5D platformer)
Kaushik Mishra

Instructions on how to run for windows:
Go to the repository (https://github.com/KMishra23/UnityFirst) and download the SecondVersion.zip file.
Extract it anywhere on your PC.
Open First.exe

To run on macOS/Linux please contact me I will send a build for the specific OS via a GDrive Link or through Discord/Whatsapp.

NOTE-
Regarding the assets used for the game that is submitted:
To see the scripts and prefabs, etc. used in the game, go to Assets/Scenes/Gaem-Files. The other files named script and prefabs, etc directly inside the assets folder are leftovers from testing different mechanics for the final game and were used in my learning process for unity. I had not deleted them in anticipation that I might need to refer to them for the final game.
